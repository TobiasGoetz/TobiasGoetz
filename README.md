### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tobias

I am currently studying computer science @DHBW-FN and work as a cooperative education student @kiongroup.  
Due to this most of my work is not available to the public because I am either bound to confidentiality agreements or created during a university course and not to be disclosed until graded.
